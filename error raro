First of all, check your network connection stability.

If there is no problem with network connection try another solution; it may work:

On Linux
Execute the following in the command line before executing the Git command:

export GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1
export GIT_TRACE=1
export GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1
On Windows
Execute the following in the command line before executing the Git command:

set GIT_TRACE_PACKET=1
set GIT_TRACE=1
set GIT_CURL_VERBOSE=1

In addition:

git config --global core.compression 0
git clone --depth 1 <repo_URI>
# cd to your newly created directory
git fetch --unshallow 
git pull --all
